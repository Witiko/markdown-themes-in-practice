\begin{abstract}
The Markdown package for \TeX{} supports themes that allow
\TeX nicians to tailor the presentation of Markdown and \acro{YAML} content
on the page. In this article, I will show the current state of Markdown
themes using the example of \LaTeX{} templates that I developed for the
International Software Testing Qualifications Board (\acro{ISTQB}).
Readers will leave with actionable steps to create or modify Markdown
themes for \LaTeX, and insights into extending these principles to other
\TeX{} engines.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Introduction}
Although \TeX{} has beautiful output, its input macro language is an acquired taste for many authors. The Markdown package for \TeX~\cite{novotny2017markdown} allows authors to type familiar Markdown and \acro{YAML} directly into a \TeX{} document and receive a similarly beautiful output.

In my previous article, I introduced Markdown themes~\cite{novotny2021markdown}. Much like \acro{CSS} stylesheets, Markdown themes allow \TeX nicians to tailor the presentation of Markdown and \acro{YAML} content without complicating the document markup for authors. While that article used simple examples to explain the basic concepts behind Markdown themes, it did not demonstrate their application on a larger scale in real-world software projects.

In July 2023, I began working with the International Software Testing Qualifications Board (\acro{ISTQB}) to create a solution for typesetting their certification study materials from Markdown and \acro{YAML} sources. We developed a \LaTeX{} document class and several Markdown themes~\cite{istqb2024productbase}, which I discuss in this article as a case study of using Markdown themes in a real-world software project.

\section{Quick recap: What's new for themes?}
\label{sec:recap}
Give a quick taste of changes to \LaTeX{} themes since version 2.10.0: \\
- Version 2.22.0 added option \texttt{import}. \\
- Version 2.23.0 added support for bulk redefinitions of token renderers and renderer prototypes using wildcards. \\
- Version 3.1.0 added command \verb|\markdownSetup| to all formats. \\
- Version 3.2.0 added support for bulk redefinitions of token renderers and renderer prototypes using enumeration. \\
- Version 3.3.0 added support for universal (cross-format) themes. \\
- Version 3.5.0 added support for incremental definitions of token renderers and renderer prototypes. \\
